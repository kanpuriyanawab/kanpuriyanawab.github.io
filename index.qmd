### Hi, I'm Anshuman.

Thanks for dropping by. I'm a software engineer at heart with a deep passion for building with stuff with large language models.

After years of contributing to the core of major open-source machine learning frameworks, I now work as an AI consultant, helping startups build robust, AI-native products. 

My expertise comes from foundational, hands-on work—implementing models from scratch, designing training pipelines, and writing technical guides.

I am also a [Google Developer Expert](https://g.dev/anshuizme) in Machine Learning.

### Who I’m Working With (Consultancy)

* **Google** → As an Independent AI Consultant, I support the Keras team by implementing state-of-the-art models in [KerasHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub) and writing technical deep-dives on their usage.

### Previous Clients (Consultancy):

- **W&B** → I focused on creating clear and compelling educational content for the machine learning community. I wrote in-depth articles, tutorials, and guides explaining complex ML concepts and demonstrating best practices using the W&B platform.

### Experience

**FlipAI** → Fifth employee of the company and 2nd **Machine Learning Engineer** hired.  My work involved the end-to-end ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and monitoring of core AI features. I also spent quite some time designing, building, and deploying applications & feature in a fast-paced production environment as per customer needs.

**Google** → Selected for the **Google Summer of Code Program** to work with the TensorFlow and Keras teams. Mainly worked on KerasHub (then KerasNLP), implementing models like Llama2, GPT NeoX from scratch and writing technical articles.

**BNY Mellon** → As a **Data Science Intern**, I gained hands-on experience within the financial services industry. My responsibilities included analyzing large datasets to uncover insights, building predictive models, and presenting my findings to support data-driven decision-making.

**Amazon** → During my **Software Engineering internship** at Amazon, I contributed to a team responsible for developing large-scale software systems. This experience provided a strong foundation in the software development lifecycle, including coding, debugging, and working with cloud infrastructure to deliver a project feature.
