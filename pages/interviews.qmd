The purpose of conducting these interviews is to mainly **get insights about the real-world project experiences, perspectives on learning new things**, some fun facts and thereby enriching the communities in the process. I sincerely thank the interviewees for taking the time out from their busy schedules and for agreeing to do these interviews. Here are the interviews I have done so far -

I have had an amazing time interviewing these incredible folks and I am grateful to them. For other competing priorities, I am discontinuing the series for an indefinite period. If you enjoy reading through interviews like these, you might want to check out the [**Machine Learning Street Talk**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMLtBahI5DMrt0NPvDSoIRQ) podcast on YouTube.
